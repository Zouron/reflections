When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When i want to collaborate with other people
-Sharing my project with other people
-Let others use my project
-Ask other people to comment on my coding style and my approach
-A demonstration so employers can see my ability to code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Choose what changes to make to remote
-Choose what other can see
-Opportunity to tidy up code before pushing
-Merge and branches we have 
-Reduce overhead of constantly pulling from remote
